# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>


## Description

   - I have built a study guide webpage because i fealt the need to help organize my study matiriels.
    
   - I was motivated to do this so i could assist myself and fellow students with the course matiriels associated with this course.

   -I learned allot through the course of the project. It started with learning how HTML, CSS, JAVA, and git hub can all be used in unison to creat something amazing that everyone interested can partake and  enjoy; Or to make their lives easier.
